# Nerve-or-Nothing
Group 13's Senior Design Code

This repository houses various versions of codes meant to measure the conformability of various nerve wrap materials around peripheral nerve tissue. The project, completed as a part of a two semester senior design course at UF for biomedical engineers, is done in collaboration with a company sponsor looking to make use of the generated data. 

The project is primarily made up of two sub-codes: one that interprets very specific images of a cylinder cross-section, with diameters ranging anywhere between 1-5 mm (integer values only), and one the interprets very specific longitudinal images of a cylinder as seen from the top.

This repository also includes an image folder with various simulated and photographed images meant to test and validate each sub-code.
